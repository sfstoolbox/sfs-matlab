Changes in the Sound Field Synthesis-Toolbox. Recent changes on top.

1.0.0-beta

    - added convolution() which is faster than conv and can handle
      multidimensional signals
    - changed default plotting style of loudspeakers to
      conf.plot.realloudspeaker=false
    - hann_window() now uses (2*n+1) instead of (2*n) to generate the window
    - replaced the input parameter L by conf.secondary_sources.size
    - the aliasing frequency is now calculated by the mean distance between the
      given secondary sources
    - added nearest neighbour search and 3D interpolation to get_ir()
    - moved the tapering window into x0(:,7), added new function
      secondary_source_tapering to achieve this
    - added a seventh column to x0 which includes integrational weights
    - added extra directory for SSR renderer functions
    - added 3D HRTF extrapolation
    - changed array configuration to use number of secondary sources instead of
      distance between them
    - changed SFS_config to use substructs like conf.secondary_sources.*
    - added the possibility to calculate the wave field for a arbritrary
      positioned plane in 3D
    - added 3D WFS functions
    - make the Toolbox work in 3D, which brakes backwards compability!
    - now all monochromatic functions have a time_domain counterpart
    - reordered the argouts for the wave field functions; now P is always the
      first argout
    - automatically plotting of the wave fields if no argouts are wanted
    - changed direction of focused source from the conf.xref vector directly
      into xs. For a focused source xs is now [1x6]

0.2.5

    - fixed a bug causing the wrong loudspeaker position in the output of
      generic_wfs()

0.2.4 (4 June 2013)

    - added a documentation to the github README
    - reworked the plotting, now simple saving to png is possible
    - added a narginchk function for older Matlab versions
    - replaced conf.frame with t in the imp functions
    - lots of small bugs were fixed

0.2.3 (9 April 2013)

    - summed up line, point, ... sources to green_function for mono and imp
    - introduced global wave_field functions for mono and imp
    - fixed binaural simulations for NFCHOA
    - removed compatibility for octave versions <3.6
    - fixed a critical bug for the HRTF farfield extrapolation, due to the new
      secondary source selection behavior

0.2.2 (27 November 2012)

    - added functions to calculate the sound pressure for monochromatic WFS at a
      single point in analogy to the point_source function
    - changed the behavior of secondary_source_selection to returning a new x0
      vector
    - added compatibility for octave 3.6
    - first fix of secondary source selection for focused sources (now they
      point always in the direction of the reference point) 

0.2.1 (15 June 2012)
    
    - added NFCHOA 2.5D monochromatic
    - added NFCHOA 2.5D binaural simulations
    - added SDM 2.5D monochromatic
    - make NFCHOA work under Octave
    - fixed direction of plane waves and point sources for NFCHOA time domain
      simulations
    - changed syntax for wave_field_* and driving_* functions:
        xs,f,src => xs,src,f
        xs,L,src => xs,src,L
        xs,L,f,src => xs,src,f,L

0.2.0 (25 April 2012)

    - first public release (under the GPLv3+ license)
